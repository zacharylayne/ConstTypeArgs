Use Cases
=========

* **Buffer Sizes:** Use const type arguments to statically define buffer sizes for collections, queues, stacks, and other data structures. This can provide type safety and ensure buffer sizes are not negative and are within specified ranges to prevent buffer overflows.

* **Implementation Selection:** Use const type arguments to choose between different implementations of a generic type based on the const type argument's value and control behavior. For example, during type initialization you could use const type argument values to modify timeout, minimum & maximum retries for network requests & database queries.

* **Units of Measure:** Use const type arguments to define delegates to convert to & from values of one unit of measure to a standardized unit of measure.

* **Type-Safe State Machines:** Use const type arguments to define states and transitions for state machines and ensure state changes are valid.

* **Event Handlers:** Use const type arguments to define event handlers for messaging and other functions. This can provide type safety and ensure that event handlers are within a specified range.

* **RegEx Patterns:** Use const type arguments to statically provide regular expression patterns for validation, parsing, and other operations. This can provide type safety and ensure that regular expression patterns are within a specified range.

* **Units of Measure:** Use const type arguments to create units of measure. This could involve base types with const type parameters for conversion factors, and derived types for specific units of measure.

* **Enum-Like Behavior:** Use const type arguments to provide enum-like behavior for generic types. This can provide type safety and ensure that only a specified set of values are used.

* **Design Patterns:** Use const type arguments to implement design patterns, such as the strategy pattern, the command pattern, and the state pattern.

* **ECS:** Use const type arguments to define systems and entities in an entity-component-system (ECS) architecture.

* **Unions:** Use const type arguments to create union-like behavior for generic types and unify behavior, for example text operations.

* **Type Mapping:** Use const type arguments to map between types, for example, mapping between different data types or between different units of measure.
