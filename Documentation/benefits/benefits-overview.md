Benefits
========

* **Type Safety:** Constraints on values can be enforced at compile-time, preventing invalid configurations and reducing runtime errors. For example, a generic `Positive<K>` type, where `K` is a const type parameter, could constrain numeric values of `K` are positive. This is particularly useful when defining  buffer sizes, timeouts, maximum numbers of retries, etc. that require values of a signed numeric type , such as `short`, `int`, `long`, etc.

* **Static Polymorphism:** The ConstTypeArgs framework enables compile-time polymorphism using const type arguments. For example, a generic could:
  * Use a const type argument's value to choose between different implementations of a method.
  * Switch on a const type argument's type to choose between different implementations.
  * Have const type arguments provide implementations by "passing" delegates to the generic using its type parameters.

* **Flexible Validation:** There are several viable means for validation const type args which users can choose from depending on their needs. Some approaches to const type argument validation include:
  * With type initialization.
  * Within module initializers.
  * Using external tools.
  * Through specialized Roslyn analyzers.

* **Domain Specific Types:** Const type arguments can be used to provide domain-specific values, such as minimums, maximums, defaults, etc. This can make code more readable and expressive. For example, const type arguments could be used to define solution-wide defaults, minimums, and maximums for buffer sizes, timeouts, & resizes.

* **Improved Readability & Expressiveness:** Const type arguments and type parameters can improve readability & expressiveness. This can reduce the need for magic numbers and provide meaningful context. A const type argument named `MaximumBufferSize` indicates its purpose. A const type parameter named `KInitialSize` is more expressive than `int size`. Improved readability & expressiveness can make code easier to understand, maintain, and debug.

* **Flexible & Reusable Components:** With const type arguments, reusable and configurable components can easily be created that allow encapsulated behaviors to be configured with const type arguments subclasses or implementors provide. This allows:
    * Enhanced scalability,
    * Easier ways to update modify code without introducing errors or breaking existing functionality,
    * Simplified configuration management,
    * Reduced code complexity & duplication,
    * And more.
  
  For example, an abstract generic base type, `BoundedCollection`, could have const type parameters that define minimum, initial, and maximum sizes of a backing buffer. Behavior in inherited types could then be controlled with const type arguments, such as a `SmallCollection`, `MediumCollection`, and `LargeCollection` type. To extend `BoundedCollection`, const type parameters can be added to allow subclasses to define resize strategies, buffer types, callbacks, and more.

*  **Enhanced Debugging:** Const type arguments can be used to provide additional context for debugging. For example, a const type argument named `MaximumBufferSize` can be used to provide additional context when debugging buffer-related issues. This can make it easier to identify the source of issues and resolve them more quickly.

* **Improved Unit Testing:** Const type arguments can improve testability by providing a clear and consistent way to configure components. This can make it easier to write unit tests for different scenarios and ensure that the code behaves as expected under different conditions.

These are just some of the benefits the ConstTypeArgs framework provides.
