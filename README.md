# ConstTypeArgs

The **Const Type Args** library provides a way to use type parameters to pass static & constant values to generic types & methods. These values, or *const type arguments*, are accessible at compile-time and can be used to define the behavior of a generic type or method, without the need to pass them as runtime arguments. This mimics [template specialization](https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/language/template_specialization) in C++ and allows for a form of compile-time computation and value propagation. This is particularly useful in situations where compile-time safety and efficiency are important.
