# Double Const Type Arguments

**Const type arguments** (also called *const type args*) are types used to pass constant & static values to generics through type parameters. These values are available at compile-time and can be used in static contexts, such as static constructors, static fields, and static methods. This can provide enhanced type safety, compile-time polymorphism, performance improvements, and more.

&nbsp;

 You can use types in the `ConstTypeArgs.Doubles` namespace for passing double values as const type arguments.

 Usage scenarios include:

 * Static configuration,
 * Eliminating unnecessary instance constructors,
 * "Passing" values to type initializers,
 * and more.
