# Bool Const Type Arguments

**Const type arguments** (also called *const type args*) are types used to pass constant & static values to generics through type parameters. These values are available at compile-time and can be used in static contexts, such as static constructors, static fields, and static methods. This can provide enhanced type safety, compile-time polymorphism, performance improvements, and more.

 You can use types in the `ConstTypeArgs.Delegates.Interlocked` namespaces for passing delegates to `System.Threading.Interlocked` methods as const type arguments.
